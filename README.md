### Expense Tracker
<p>•	A Single-Page web application that tracks monthly expenses of a user, shows information about user’s expenses in a period of a month.</p>

this project is not my original idea but i was coding along as a response with Udemy Max Schwarzmueller 's Course :  React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) . i've written by myself all the React code found in here , also added more features later to the application by myself , such as the routing , making it a SPA like app , and connecting it to realtime database provided by google firebase making the data stored in a database never lost upon refrsh.
