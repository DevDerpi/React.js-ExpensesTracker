this project is not my original idea but i was coding along as a response with Udemy Max Schwarzmueller 's Course :  React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) . i've written by myself all the React code found in here  without copying anything except the CSS scripts used for styling.
instructions : 
To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects).
DISCALIMER : This project is done as a practice project for educational purposes, and i don't owe the copyrights of it , copyrights belong to Max Schwarzmueller of Academind , and you can find the course @ https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux
