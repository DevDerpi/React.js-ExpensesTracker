this project is not my original idea but i was coding along as a response with Udemy Max Schwarzmueller 's Course :  React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) . i've written by myself all the React code found in here  without copying anything except the CSS codes used for styling.
instructions : 
to run the React.js-ExpensesTracker project you have to have node.js installed on your machine then : 
        1-Download it 
        2-use your console to cd to the project directory
        3-type command : " npm install" to install dependencies of project
        4-type command : "npm start" to start development server and it will run the project on localhost:3000      .
DISCALIMER : This project is done as a practice project for educational purposes, and i don't owe the copyrights of it , copyrights belong to Max Schwarzmueller of Academind , and you can find the course @ https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux
